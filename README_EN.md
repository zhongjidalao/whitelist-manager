## 📖 Introduction

Whitelist Manager is an automation tool developed in Go that monitors public IP changes in real-time and automatically updates cloud firewall whitelist rules, ensuring only your current IP can access your servers.

### 🎯 Use Cases

- **Dynamic IP Environments**: Home broadband, mobile offices where IP addresses change frequently
- **Security Hardening**: Restrict service access sources to prevent brute force attacks and unauthorized access
- **Remote Work**: Automatically adapt to different network environments without manual security group rule modifications
- **Multi-Port Management**: Manage whitelist access control for multiple service ports simultaneously
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Manage Volcengine security groups and AWS Lightsail firewall rules in one workflow

### ✨ Key Features

- 🔄 **Automatic Monitoring**: Periodic public IP change detection (default 15 minutes, customizable)
- 🔐 **Auto Whitelist Updates**: Real-time synchronization of IP changes to cloud firewall rules
- ☁️ **Multi-Provider Support**: Supports Volcengine and AWS Lightsail
- 🌐 **Web Management Interface**: Visual configuration panel and log monitoring
- 🚀 **Multi-Port Support**: Configure multiple ports at once (e.g., 22,8080,3389), comma-separated
- 📊 **Complete Log Recording**: All operations are traceable with pagination support and clear function
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Written in Go, low resource consumption, fast response
- 📦 **Zero Dependency Deployment**: Single binary file, no additional runtime environment required
- 🔁 **Intelligent Retry**: Automatic switching between multiple IP query sources for high availability
- 🛡️ **Fault Tolerance Design**: Automatically skips when configuration is incomplete, avoiding misoperations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### System Requirements

- **Build Environment**: Go 1.20 or higher
- **Runtime Environment**: Linux / macOS / Windows
- **Network Requirements**: Access to cloud provider APIs and public IP query services

### Installation

#### Method 1: Build from Source

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd volcengine-whitelist-manager

# 2. Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# 3. Build binary
go build -o volcengine-whitelist-manager cmd/server/main.go

# 4. Run program
./volcengine-whitelist-manager
```

#### Method 2: Run Directly (Development Mode)

```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

### Initial Configuration

1. **Start Service**
   After the program starts, visit `http://localhost:9877`

2. **Navigate to Settings Page**
   Click the "Settings" button in the navigation bar

3. **Fill in Configuration**

   | Configuration | Description | Example |
   |--------------|-------------|---------|
   | Provider | Cloud provider | `volcengine` / `aws` |
   | Access Key | Cloud API access key | `AKLT...` / `AKIA...` |
   | Secret Key | Cloud API secret key | *** |
   | Region | Resource region | `cn-beijing`, `ap-southeast-1` |
   | Security Group ID | Volcengine: security group ID; AWS: Lightsail instance name | `sg-xxxxxx` / `my-lightsail-instance` |
   | Ports | Ports to manage | `22` or `22,8080,3389` |
   | Check Interval | Check interval | `15` (minutes) |
   | IP Services | IP query service list | Multiple backup sources pre-configured |

4. **Save and Test**
   After clicking "Save Settings", you can click the "Run Now" button on the homepage to trigger an immediate update

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### Multi-Port Configuration

Use comma-separated values in the "Ports" field:

```
22,8080,3389,5000
```

The program will create independent security group rules for each port.

### Custom IP Query Services

Default services used (attempted in order):
- https://myip.ipip.net
- https://ddns.oray.com/checkip
- https://ip.3322.net
- https://v4.yinghualuo.cn/bejson

You can add custom services in the "IP Services" field on the settings page, one URL per line.

### Check Interval Time

- Minimum: 60 seconds
- Recommended: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
- Unit support: seconds / minutes / hours

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Getting "Incomplete configuration" error?**
A: Ensure Access Key, Secret Key, Region, and Security Group ID are all correctly filled in.

**Q: Cannot get public IP?**
A: Check network connection or add more backup IP query services in settings.

**Q: Security group rule update failed?**
A: Check the following:
- Does the Access Key have security group modification permissions?
- Is the Security Group ID correct?
- Does the Region configuration match the security group's region?

**Q: Where is the database file?**
A: Automatically created at `instance/config.db`, in the same directory as the executable.

**Q: How to change the listening port?**
A: Edit line 47 in `cmd/server/main.go`, change `:9877` to another port.

## 📊 Log Description

### Log Levels

- **INFO**: Normal operation records (IP checks, successful rule updates)
- **WARNING**: Warning messages (IP service unavailable, configuration skipped)
- **ERROR**: Error messages (API call failures, authorization failures)

### Log Examples

```
[INFO] Starting IP check...
[INFO] Current public IP: 123.45.67.89 (source: https://myip.ipip.net)
[INFO] Port 22: Revoking old rule 111.22.33.44/32
[INFO] Port 22: Adding new rule 123.45.67.89/32
[INFO] ✓ Port 22: Updated to allow 123.45.67.89/32
```

## 🔒 Security Recommendations

1. **Credential Management**: Do not commit Access Key and Secret Key to version control systems
2. **Least Privilege**: Create a dedicated RAM user for the program with only security group modification permissions
3. **Port Restrictions**: Only open necessary ports, avoid using `0.0.0.0/0` rules
4. **Log Auditing**: Regularly check logs for abnormal operations
5. **HTTPS Access**: In production environments, consider configuring a reverse proxy (Nginx) with HTTPS enabled
